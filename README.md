# Drowse-Detect
A hackathon project made in iNTUition - a hackathon organised by IEEE in NTU.  
  
  
Drowse-Detect is used to detect drowsiness in drivers, and sounds an alarm to wake the driver up, to avoid an accident.  
This would alert the driver as well as the passengers and we feel that this could be very beneficial in real-world applications.
